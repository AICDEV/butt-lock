### what's butt-lock ?
It's an example of how a ransomware could work. In this particular case, butt-lock will encrypt all file on the hard disk (selectable / configurable as param) with
a random generated aes-cbc key. Before the encryption process starts, butt-lock will also create a rsa public and private key with a length of 4096 and reads your
mac address. The aes-key itselfs will be encrypted with the generated public key, after that the public key will be deleted. The "output" after the encryption process
is finished, is the base64 encoded rsa-oaep encrypted aes-cbc key, the mac-address and the private key (that's the important information, without a private key you are not able to decrypt the aes key).

You could send the butt-lock output object to you by email, twitter or whatever you prefer and... ;-). But remeber, it's only for education. DON'T DO IT!
